some important instructions regarding type casting of both implicit and explicit type
1. there is no ob.nextChar() method and so char cant be taken as input
be careful about making that mistake
2. String cannot be converted to char
3. some important ascii values:
    A-Z uppercase = 65-90
    a-z lowercase = 97-122
    0-9 = 48-57
    space = 32
    symbols = 33-47 (even space is a symbol)
4. Type casting works automatically as wide casting while moving from primitive
to non-primitive data. Example: char to int and int to double. In the second example,
the compiler will automatically convert the int to double but double doesnt get converted 
to int automatically but instead needs explicit type casting.
